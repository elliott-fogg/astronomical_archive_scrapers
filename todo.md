# To-do

## Extract clearer exposure patterns
* Solidify the extraction of patterns
* Extract cadences of exposure patterns from the data
Might have to do this by eye, and may have to group OGG and COJ data.

## SSH issue fixed
Had to set the remote url from 'http://github.com/...' to 
'ssh://git@github.com/...'
